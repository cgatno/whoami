# whoami

This is whoami, which is short for "Who am I?" for you classicists who still write in full sentences. It's the source code for my [personal website](https://christiangaetano.com), blog and some random code experiments.

## How It's Made

I'm using the awesome static site generator [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to build out this project. Gatsby uses React to compartmentalize pages, layouts, components and more. So if you're familiar with React and JSX, figuring out the code here should be a breeze.

> If you're trying to choose a technology to build your next site and it can be done as a static site, I highly recommend checking out Gatsby. It's an excellent tool for creating insanely fast websites, and it will help you use modern best practices as you code.

As for hosting, I'm using automated deployment with GitHub and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Gatsby has some great Netlify integration plugins which boosts the performance of your site even further.

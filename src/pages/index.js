      <i>Hello,</i>
    </h1>
    <p>
      My name&apos;s Christian Gaetano. I&apos;m a software engineer with a
      passion for building delightful &amp; meaningful experiences on the web.
      And even though it&apos;s not my day job, I love helping to design those
      experiences when I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you&apos;ve managed to find my personal website, I&apos;m willing to
      bet you&apos;re on a mission to uncover all of my deepest, darkest
      secrets. Really though, you&apos;re probably looking for something
      specific. If that&apos;s the case, feel free to head straight to my resume
      or peruse my portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course &mdash; if you&apos;re just here for a good time &mdash;{" "}
      <i>please</i>, read on!
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S. <i>You&apos;ve come to the right place</i>.

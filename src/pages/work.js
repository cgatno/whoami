          <p>
            This one was for my day job, but that didn&apos;t detract from the
            intrigue at all! I was given the lead on revamping our webinars
            page, so I opened up Sketch and mocked away. A few iterations later,
            we landed on a design we liked, and the team and I planned out
            implementation with our static site generator.
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            This was one of the first projects where I headed up design, and I
            learned <i>a lot</i> in the process. Using Sketch symbols in the
            original design made it easy to iterate, and laying out copy ahead
            of time made the implementation go much more quickly.

            We worked together to develop a brand new website that group members

            deep dives to continuously optimize the site for the relatively
            small but very targeted audience.

            For a month or so, I put a &ldquo;pause&rdquo; on development of new

            myself to the point of no return as I dug into the technical details
            of the most popular front-end JavaScript frameworks. This e-book is
            the culmination of that research, plus a good bit of (not
            necessarily company-condoned) insomniac writing.

            A quick blog post I threw together in the weeks leading up to the
            release of C# 7. Even though tuples had been around in the language
            for awhile, they were pretty unwieldy and a little uncommon. Since
            the 7.0 updates were promising to change <i>everything</i>, I
            decided to look into how the new tuple value type might make these
            structures easier to use in C#.

            One of the first professional, business grade websites I ever worked
            on, the R.T. Patterson project is one I&apos;ll never forget. A
            college friend and I had just started working together as a
            freelance team, and we were extremely excited to land such a well
            known client who was equally excited to work with us.

          <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            It was a lot of fun to develop requirements and iterate on designs,
            plus we got to build a sweet mobile navigation menu that is plan{" "}
            <i>smooth</i> on touch devices. (Which wasn&apos;t so easy at the

            As we started to take on more clients and found ourselves happily
            devoting tons of time to web design projects, my friend and I
            decided to make our business official. (Well, the government sort of
            decided for us with taxes and whatnot. But we already wanted to make
            it official anyways!)

            Since then, our website has gone through more than its fair share of
            redesigns and technology changes, and the current version is one of
            the simplest yet. We spent a couple of weeks designing and building
            out this minimalist, fast-loading layout. It&apos;s lightweight and
            uses cloud functions to send mail, which is perfect for our current
            status. We&apos;ve been winding down operations as we both pursue
            some other goals in our lives, but we&apos;re always more than happy
            to talk about design with anyone!
